Software Transactional Memory (STM)
There are two folders: stm_race_conditions and stm_deadlocks

 the first folder: stm_race_conditions 
it contains 3 packages: race_conditions, lock_based_synchronization, and transactional_memory 
race_conditions package contains the code which shows the occurrence of race conditions; 
lock_based_synchronisation package contains the code which shows how lock-based synchronization can be used to prevent the occurrence of race conditions. 
 finally, the transactional_memory package contains multiverse library and simply shows the concept of STM prevents the occurrences of race conditions 

the second folder: stm_deadlocks
it consists of two packages: deadlock_lbs and deadlocks_stm
deadlock_lbs package shows how deadlocks can occur when lock-based synchronisation is used 
deadlock_stm package shows how deadlocks do not occur when STM approach is used
